				<h3>1931 - Kurt Godel</h3>
				<p>The work of Kurt Godel left a foundation for other AI pioneers to build upon. Godel is credited with setting up theoretical computer science. TCS includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and more. These fields have become extremely important to AI as we see it today.</p>

				<h3>1936 - Alan Turing</h3>
				<p>Alan Turing is most famous for cracking the German Enigma machine during World War II, but perhaps his largest success was the invention of the Turing machine in 1936. Turing was able to reformulate much of the work that Godel had started and did so much more efficiently.</p>

				<h3>1935-1941 - Konrad Zuse</h3>
				<p>Meanwhile Konrad Zuse was busy working on his own additions to AI. He built the very first functioning program-controlled computers between 1935 and 1941. He even went on to write the first chess playing program which was a basic AI in itself.</p>

				<h3>1940s - Hardware Advancements</h3>
				<p>Now, thanks to Godel, Turing, and Zuse, the beginnings of modern computer science were in place. Through the 1940s the technology of the computers themselves were drastically improved. This improvement was critical to the success of future AI attempts.</p>

				<h3>1950s - AI Defined</h3>
				<p>In 1950 Alan Turing created a test that determined whether a machine was intelligent or not. Shortly thereafter in 1956 John McCarthy coined the term Artificial Intelligence.</p>
