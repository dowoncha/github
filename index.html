        		<h4>History of AI</h4>
        		<p>The history of artificial intelligence back to the theories of Aristotle, but it wasnâ€™t until 1931 that AI as we know it today became a possibility.</p>

        		<h4>1931 - Kurt Godel</h4>
        		<p>The work of Kurt Godel left an extremely brilliant foundation for other AI pioneers to build upon. Godel is credited with setting up the beginnings of theoretical computer science.1 Theoretical computer science, or TCS, includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and more.2 These fields have become extremely important to AI as we see it today.</p>

        		<h4>1936 - Alan Turing</h4>
        		<p>Alan Turing is most famous for cracking the German Enigma machine during World War II, but perhaps his largest success was the invention of the Turing machine in 1936. Turing was able to reformulate much of the work that Godel had started and did so much more efficiently.</p>

        		<h4>1935-1941 - Konrad Zuse</h4>
        		<p>Meanwhile Konrad Zuse was busy working on his own additions to AI. He built the very first functioning program-controlled computers between 1935 and 1941.1 He even went on to write the first chess playing program which was a basic AI in itself.1 Now, thanks to Godel, Turing, and Zuse, the beginnings of modern computer science were in place.</p>
