				<h3>1931 - Kurt Godel</h3>
				<p>The work of Kurt Godel left a foundation for other AI pioneers to build upon. Godel is credited with setting up theoretical computer science. TCS includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and more. These fields have become extremely important to AI as we see it today.</p>

				<h3>1936 - Alan Turing</h3>
				<p>Alan Turing is most famous for cracking the German Enigma machine during World War II, but perhaps his largest success was the invention of the Turing machine in 1936. Turing was able to reformulate much of the work that Godel had started and did so much more efficiently.</p>

				<h3>1935-1941 - Konrad Zuse</h3>
				<p>Meanwhile Konrad Zuse was busy working on his own additions to AI. He built the very first functioning program-controlled computers between 1935 and 1941. He even went on to write the first chess playing program which was a basic AI in itself.</p>

				<h3>1940s - Hardware Advancements</h3>
				<p>Now, thanks to Godel, Turing, and Zuse, the beginnings of modern computer science were in place. Through the 1940s the technology of the computers themselves were drastically improved. This improvement was critical to the success of future AI attempts.</p>

				<p>“At the start of January, an insurance firm in Japan replaced more than 30 employees with an artificial intelligence system. Based on IBM Watson Explorer, the cognitive technology that processes and can understand reams of data, the system was introduced to increase productivity by 30 per cent, and will give the firm a return on its investment in less than two years.” (Heathman)</p>

					<h1>Pop Culture</h1>
					<p>Artificial Intelligence is popular in our culture. Many sci-fi authors have
						their own interpretations and predictions on robot development.</p>
						<p>Let's explore the possibilities our reality can become. How will the first
							intelligent AI appear? Hidden away in a genius' secret lab? <a href="#/machina">Machina</a>

						<h3>How the Singularity Might Begin</h3>
						<table width=100% height=100%>
							<tr>
								<td width=50%>
									<h5>Ex Machina</h5>
									<p>You can't release an untested unexplored AI into the wild without proper testing.
										However, you are also keeping an intelligent born in a prison meant to stay there. Intelligence
										implies it will question its creator, its world, and its existence. It will very likely go mad.</p>
									</td>
									<td width=50% style="background-color: blue">
										<h5>Transcendence</h5>
										<p>Due to the dificulty of coding an intelligence there are alternatives. What if we found a way to put
											Johnny Depp into a computer. He is an intelligent being but now with the super powers of the internet. Do we consider
											that as the development of the singularity or is it a human mind which has gone power hungry.</p>
