        			<li class="fragment fade-in"><b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI/Strong AI)</b> = Intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can and is as smart as a human across the board.</li>
        			<li class="fragment fade-in"><b>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</b> = Said by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom to be "an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills."</li>

        		<h3>THE TURING TEST</h3>
        		<p>Man vs. Computer: One participant must be able to distinguish human from computer.
        		If the participant cannot distinguish the two then the computer has passed.</p>

        		<h3>THE COFFEE TEST</h3>
        		<p>A test created by Ben Goertzel and made more popular behind the voice of Steve Wozniak where the AI passes if it can go into an average American house and figure out how to make coffee, 
        		including identifying the coffee machine, figuring out what the buttons do, finding the coffee in the cabinet, etc. on its own

        		<h3>THE ROBOT COLLEGE STUDENT TEST</h3>
        		<p>This test was also created in 2012 by Ben Goertzel and suggests that we will have created an artificial general intelligence once a robot can enroll in a human university and take classes in the same way as humans, and get its degree.</p>

        		<h3>THE EMPLOYMENT TEST</h3>
        		<p>Nils John Nilsson (an american born computer scientist and one AI's founding researchers) suggested the most difficult test for AI where it should be able to be <i>employed</i>, meaning the AI must have at least the poritential to completely automate economically important jobs.</p>
